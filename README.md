# Apache Beam starter for Java

## Before you begin

Make sure you have a [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29) development environment ready.
If you don't, an easy way to install it is with [`sdkman`](https://sdkman.io).

> ℹ️ Apache Beam currently only supports Java 8 (LTS) and Java 11 (LTS).
>
> ⚠️ **[Java 8 ends its active support in March 2022](https://endoflife.date/java)**, so we recommend using Java 11 (LTS) until Java 17 (LTS) is supported.

```sh
# Install sdkman.
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash

# Make sure you have Java 11 installed.
sdk install java 11.0.12-tem
```

## Source file structure

This is a very basic Apache Beam project to help you get started.

There are only two source files:

* [`src/main/java/com/example/App.java`](src/main/java/com/example/App.java): the application source file, containing the [`main` method](src/main/java/com/example/App.java). The _main class_ is `com.example.App`.
* [`src/test/java/com/example/AppTest.java`](src/test/java/com/example/AppTest.java): tests for the `App.java` file.

> ℹ️ Most build tools expect all the Java source files to be under `src/main/java/` and tests to be under `src/test/java/` by default.

### Option A: Gradle

[Gradle](https://gradle.org) is a build tool focused on flexibility and performance.

This is a build tool widely used by many projects.

```sh
sdk install gradle
```

A basic Gradle setup consists of a [`build.gradle`](build.gradle) file written in [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org) or [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org).

```sh
# To do a simple run.
gradle run

# To run passing command line arguments.
gradle run -Pargs=--inputText="🎉"

# To run the tests.
gradle test --info
```

To build a self-contained jar file, we need to configure the [`jar`](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.bundling.Jar.html) task in the [`build.gradle`](build.gradle) file.

```sh
# Build a self-contained jar.
gradle jar

# Run the jar application.
java -jar build/pipeline.jar --inputText="🎉"
```

### Option B: sbt

[`sbt` (Scala Build Tool)](https://www.scala-sbt.org/index.html) is a type-safe build tool for Scala and Java projects.
Since it's type-safe, most errors are caught before the build starts.

This is probably the simplest option, but isn't as widely used as Gradle.

```sh
sdk install sbt
```

A basic `sbt` setup consists of a [`build.sbt`](build.sbt) file written in a Scala-based DSL, and optionally a [`project/plugins.sbt`](project/plugins.sbt) file.

```sh
# To do a simple run.
sbt run

# To run passing command line arguments.
sbt 'run --inputText="🎉"'

# To run the tests.
sbt test
```

To build a self-contained jar file, we need to import [`sbt-assembly`](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly) in the [`project/plugins.sbt`](project/plugins.sbt) file and configure it in the [`build.sbt`](build.sbt) file.

```sh
# Build a self-contained jar.
sbt assembly

# Run the jar application.
java -jar build/pipeline.jar --inputText="🎉"
```

### Option C: Apache Maven _(not recommended)_

[Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org) is a project management and comprehension tool based on the concept of a project object model (POM).

This is by far the trickiest to configure, but many older projects still use it.

If you are starting a new project, we recommend using Gradle or `sbt` instead.

> ℹ️ If you have an existing Maven project, consider looking at a [Gradle vs Maven comparison](https://gradle.org/maven-vs-gradle), as well as Gradle's [Migrating builds from Apache Maven](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/migrating_from_maven.html) guide.

```sh
sdk install maven
```

A basic Apache Maven setup consists of a [`pom.xml`](pom.xml) file written in [XML](https://www.w3schools.com/xml).

To run the app through Maven, we need to configure [`exec-maven-plugin`](http://www.mojohaus.org/exec-maven-plugin) in the [`pom.xml`](pom.xml) file.

```sh
# To do a simple run.
mvn compile exec:java

# To run passing command line arguments.
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.args=--inputText="🎉"

# To run the tests.
mvn test
```

To build a self-contained jar file, we need to configure [`maven-assembly-plugin`](https://people.apache.org/~epunzalan/maven-assembly-plugin/index.html) in the [`pom.xml`](pom.xml) file.

```sh
# Build a self-contained jar.
mvn package

# Run the jar application.
java -jar target/beam-java-starter-1-jar-with-dependencies.jar --inputText="🎉"
```

## GitHub Actions automated testing

This project already comes with automated testing via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

To configure it, look at the [`.github/workflows/test.yaml`](.github/workflows/test.yaml) file.

## Using other runners

To keep this template small, it only includes the [Direct Runner](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/direct/).

For a comparison of what each runner currently supports, look at the [Beam Capability Matrix](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/capability-matrix/).

To add a new runner, visit the runner's page for instructions on how to include it.
